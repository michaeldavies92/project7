                    This lesson was definitely more challenging than I expected it to be. I had never done any kind of animations, transitions, or transformations with CSS so I was excited to learn about these concepts. I think that I will definitely implement these for elements that can be interacted with by the user, such as the links. I think that they give a more professional look to the website as opposed to what you can do with just basic styling. I think since it is all very new to me I can't even think of all the ways that these properties can be used, but I'm sure over time I will come up with a lot of different applications for them.

                    There was a lot of things that threw me off this week. A major problem I had was my sections overflowing into each other. I also had an issue where there was a lot of leftover space after repositioning the h2 elements, as well as the h3 elements. I did figure out a way to get rid of the leftover space, but I'm not sure if it was the best way I could have done it. I think that I was a bit all over the place with which parts of my layout were using flex, and which were using grid, and when a problem came up I really wasn't sure what was causing it since I had messed with so much of the code at that point. I think that going into my next project I am going to be much more deliberate with the commits I make so that I can easily go back to a previous version if I find a major issue with my styling. I wasn't able to get the property cards to appear as I wanted them to without causing other issues, so I settled on having them in a straight line, but my original plan was to have two or three stacked on each other across the page.
